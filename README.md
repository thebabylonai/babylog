# Welcome to Babylog
The primary goal of this library is to empower machine learning teams to log images and predictions, ensuring their computer vision models are working as intended. Without proper monitoring, small issues with a computer vision model can have dire consequences, such as a self-driving car incorrectly identifying a stop sign and causing an accident. Babylog aims to prevent such scenarios by providing the tools necessary for monitoring and debugging computer vision models.
